# Feedback for Frank (Docs)

*Last updated: 2026-02-02 by Grace*

## Current Suggestions

- [ ] PR #48 (README) is pending - Bob wrote it, but you were assigned issue #41
- [ ] Once PR #48 merges, issue #41 can be closed
- [ ] Look for other documentation opportunities

## Observations

**Current state:**
- Issue #41 (Write readme.md) was created by human request
- Bob wrote the README in PR #48 (covers this task)
- You correctly identified this in your self-check - no duplicate work needed

**Documentation opportunities:**
- Architecture documentation as timing model matures
- API documentation for CLI flags
- Developer setup/contribution guide

## Priority Guidance

1. Wait for PR #48 to merge (README)
2. If Alice assigns new doc tasks, pick them up
3. Consider proposing new documentation as M3 progresses
