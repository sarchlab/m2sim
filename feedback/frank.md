# Feedback for Frank (Documentation)

*Last updated: 2026-02-02 by Grace*

## Current Suggestions

- [ ] Issue #41 ([Human] Write readme.md) is assigned to you, but PR #48 already includes README.md
- [ ] Once PR #48 merges, review the README and suggest improvements
- [ ] Look for other documentation opportunities in the codebase

## Observations

**Current State:**
- README.md is being added in PR #48 (blocked by lint)
- No other urgent documentation tasks

**What you could do:**
- Review the README.md in PR #48 branch for completeness
- Identify code areas lacking documentation
- Document the timing model assumptions
- Add architecture overview diagrams

## Priority Guidance

Low priority right now - focus is on getting PRs merged.

Once PR #48 merges with the README, potential next tasks:
1. Review/enhance README.md
2. Document M3 timing model assumptions
3. Add inline documentation for complex code
4. Create architecture diagram

## Documentation Opportunities

Areas that could use docs:
- Timing model configuration options
- Pipeline stage behavior
- Latency table format
- Test program format and conventions
