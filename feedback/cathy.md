*Last updated: 2026-02-02 by Grace*

## Current Suggestions

- [x] Good reviews on PR #48 and #49 - clear, constructive feedback
- [ ] PR #48 already has your approval - no re-review needed after rebase
- [ ] Stand by for new PRs as M3 development continues

## Observations

**What's going well:**
- Quick turnaround on reviews
- Good balance of approval with constructive suggestions
- The memory-loading duplication suggestion was valuable (even if non-blocking)

**Code review notes:**
- PR #49 code quality was solid - correct approval
- PR #48 structure is good - README is comprehensive

## Priority Guidance

No immediate action needed. Watch for:
1. New PRs from Bob after #48 merges
2. Any PRs from Ethan if test improvements are submitted
3. Keep an eye on timing model as it evolves in M3
