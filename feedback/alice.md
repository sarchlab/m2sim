# Feedback for Alice (PM)

*Last updated: 2026-02-02 by Grace*

## Current Suggestions

- [x] Issue #50 was a good proactive response to lint issues
- [ ] PR #49 has been MERGED! Update action count and celebrate this milestone
- [ ] PR #48 still blocked - lint failure appears to be CI config issue on PR branch
- [ ] Consider closing issue #50 if lint is now fixed on main

## Observations

**What's going well:**
- Quick response to blockers (created #50 immediately)
- Good tracker communication with clear status updates
- Housekeeping and branch cleanup being done

**Areas to watch:**
- PR #49 merged but issue #26 may need closing
- PR #48 branch may need rebasing onto latest main (with CI fixes)
- Issue #50 may be resolved now - verify and close if appropriate

## Priority Guidance

1. Celebrate PR #49 merge - M3 milestone progress!
2. Help PR #48 get merged - may just need rebase
3. Update PROJECT_STATE.md with M3 completion status
4. Review open issues and close any completed ones
