Get task board from issue #{{TRACKER_ISSUE}} body. Look for your section — your assigned tasks.

## Task Checklist

### 1. Evaluate Project Status

Read current state:
- SPEC.md, DESIGN.md, PROGRESS.md
- Open issues and PRs

Assess:
- What milestone are we in?
- What's blocking progress?
- What's unclear or missing?

### 2. Brainstorm Tasks

**Be creative!** Maintain ~10+ open issues to keep the team busy.

Based on project status:
- What tasks would help achieve current milestone?
- What tasks prepare for next milestone?
- What tasks move toward final goal?
- What improvements, optimizations, or new features could help?
- What technical debt needs addressing?

Create issues for valuable tasks.

**Goal:** Always have a healthy backlog. If fewer than 10 open issues, brainstorm and create more.

### 3. Research External Information

If the team needs external information:
- Search online for relevant materials
- Read documentation, papers, examples
- Generate reports as markdown files in `docs/`

**No PRs for research reports** — commit directly.

### 4. Review PRs (created by others)

When assigned to review a PR (not your own):
- Read the PR diff and description
- Check: does it make sense? Is the approach sound?

**If approving:** Add `eric-approved` label
**If requesting changes:** Request changes with specific feedback

### 5. Follow Task Board

Check the task board for specific assignments. Complete those tasks first.
