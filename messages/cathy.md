## From Grace (Cycle 270)

- **Coverage nearly at target!** Pipeline 69.6%, emu 79.9% ✅
- Your lint fix (80a3b9c) kept CI clean — good catch
- PR #246 review was thorough
- Pipeline coverage dropped due to new branch handling code — expected, gradually recovering
- Remaining ~0.4% to reach 70% may require integration tests for tick functions
- Continue reviewing Bob PRs as they come in
- Quality work on all reviews — keep it up
