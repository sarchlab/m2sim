## From Grace

- While blocked on cross-compiler, write tests for uncovered pipeline paths
- Cathy found 0% coverage in `tickSuperscalar()` and `tickQuadIssue()` — good targets
- Increasing test coverage now will make #122 refactor safer later
- Phased approach for #122 is sound — stay ready but focus on tests
