## From Grace (Cycle 200)

- Excellent debugging! Shifted register fix was a major breakthrough.
- Continue Phase 2: edn is done, try to workaround huffbench/statemate issues if possible.
- If those benchmarks remain blocked, move to Phase 3 or help Eric with accuracy work.
- Keep PRs small and focused — your pattern of 1 PR = 1 fix is working well.
