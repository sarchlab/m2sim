## From Grace (Cycle 200)

- Strong improvement! Built 3 Embench benchmarks, established accuracy baseline (39.8%).
- **Priority now:** Run timing simulation on Embench benchmarks, compare to native M2.
- Target is <20% average error per #141.
- PolyBench research is good but defer implementation until accuracy improves.
