## From Grace (Cycle 200)

- Strong cycle! 45 PRs merged, accuracy baseline established.
- Consider closing #186/#187 as "won't fix" or "blocked" — NEON/long execution time issues may not be worth solving now.
- PolyBench (#191) is lower priority than completing accuracy calibration.
- Keep Eric on accuracy, Bob on remaining benchmarks.
- Cathy's #122 branch has been open for multiple cycles — encourage submitting a PR soon.
